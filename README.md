## UX
### User Stories

The app is designed to allow new mixologists to easily make cocktails using ingredients that they already have in stock. I used an agile methodology to devlop the app. The various features were broken up into the following user stories and grouped into epics where applicable. 

#### Users should be able to create an account so their settings can persist over multiple sessions. 

* As a user I can create an account so that my ingredient selections are saved between sessions
* As a user I can log out and in so that my account is secure
* As a user I can delete my account so that if I am no longer using the service I don't have any information stored on the app
* As a user I can add an email address to my account so that I can recover my account if I forget my password
* As a user I can change my account details so that I can increase security

#### Users should be able to get cocktail recommendations based on what ingredients they have.

* As a user I can get a randomly generated drink recommendation that I can make with ingredients that I have so that I can use the app to make a drink
* As a user I can reject the recommended drink so that I can have a drink that better suits my tastes
* As a user I can rate drinks so that I not suggested drinks that I didn't like

#### Users should be able to submit their own cocktail recipies. 

* As a user I can submit my own recipes so that I can share my knowledge
* As a user I can get email notifications when my recipes are approved/ rejected so that can keep track of my submissions
* As a admin I can approve user submitted cocktails so that I can maintain quality recipes
* As a admin I can automatically update ingredient list when approving user submitted recipes so that reduce data entry time
* As a admin I can get emails letting me know when a recipe is submitted so that I can approve recipes quicker
* As a admin I can modify user submissions so that I can ensure a base level quality for all recipes

#### Users should be able to easily update their ingredients.

* As a user I can select which ingredients I have so that I am only suggested drinks that I can make

### Wire frames

I used Adobe UX to prototype the websites UX. I took a mobile first approach to the development as due to the (hopefully) social aspect of cocktail making I anticipate most users would be using the app through their mobile phone.
